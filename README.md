# Benten Avatar Framework

Open-source personal AI framework that builds your knowledge graph (a personal wiki) and coordinates specialized AI agents to help achieve your goals.

## Overview
The Benten Avatar Framework helps you build and maintain a dynamic knowledge graph through natural conversation with an AI assistant. Starting with Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic's most advanced AI model), it automatically organizes your thoughts, ideas, and insights into an evolving personal wiki. This forms the foundation for your personal AI ecosystem, designed to grow with you over time.

## ðŸš§ Project Status
Early development - Core functionality under active development. This MVP focuses on:
- Command-line conversation interface with Claude
- Automated knowledge extraction and wiki creation
- Knowledge graph visualization through Obsidian
- Foundation for future agent extensibility and coordination

## Current Features
- **Natural Conversation**: Chat with Claude through a simple command-line interface
- **Automated Knowledge Management**: Conversations automatically contribute to your personal wiki
- **Dynamic Graph Building**: Auto-generated and linked markdown files
- **Visual Knowledge Map**: Obsidian integration for knowledge graph visualization
- **Extensible Design**: Built to support future integration with additional AI agents and extensions
